The purpose of this VPI test example is to illustrate how to traverse
a design and obtain various information about Verilog objects by using
VPI functions.

To run the example, bring up the simulator and type the following at the prompt:
     do run.do
or, to run from a shell, type the following at the shell prompt:
     vsim -c -do run.do
(omit the "-c" to see the GUI while running from the shell)

The files are organized as follows:

dff.v               A dff module marked as a cell and with a timescale
                    different than the top-level module.

expected_results    Test results that should be seen in the transcript
                    after running vsim.

prim.v              A UDP of each type (combinational and sequential).

top.v               The top level module containing examples of ports, nets,
                    registers, variables, scopes, and instances.

vpi_test.c          The VPI application code.

vpi_test.exports    An export file to export symbols for the IBM platform.

run.do              A vsim dofile to run the simulation and display results.
