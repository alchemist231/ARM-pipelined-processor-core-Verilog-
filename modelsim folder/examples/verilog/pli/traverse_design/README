The purpose of this PLI test example is to illustrate how to traverse
a design and obtain various information about Verilog objects by using
PLI functions.

The files are organized as follows:

dff.v               A dff module marked as a cell and with a timescale
                    different than the top-level module.

expected_results    Test results that should be seen in the transcript
                    after running vsim.

pli_test.c          The PLI application code.

pli_test.exports    An export file to export symbols for the Windows platform.

prim.v              A UDP of each type (combinational and sequential).

runtest.bat         A script to run the test in a DOS shell on the Windows
                    platform.

runtest.lnx         A script to run the test on the 32-bit Linux platform.

runtest.lnx64       A script to run the test on the 64-bit Linux platform.

runtest.ss5         A script to run the test on the 32-bit Sun Solaris platform.

runtest.ss5v9       A script to run the test on the 64-bit Sun Solaris platform.

runtest.win         A script to run the test in an MKS shell on the Windows
                    platform.

runtest_win.do      A do file to run the test from a ModelSim command line
                    on the Windows platform.

top.v               The top level module containing examples of ports, nets,
                    registers, variables, scopes, and instances.

vsim.do             A vsim dofile to run the simulation and display results.

NOTE: Each runtest script should be edited to run the appropriate compiler
      and linker for your system and to point to your modeltech installation
      for the include files.
